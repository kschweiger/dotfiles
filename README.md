# dotfiles
This is a place to save (and possibly share) my configuration files for various programs

Feel free to copy/share whatever you like!

After cloning:
```shell 
ln -s dotfiles/zsh/zsh_settings .zsh_settings
ln -s dotfiles/zsh/zsh_functions .zsh_functions
ln -s dotfiles/zsh/zsh_aliases .zsh_aliases

ln -s dotfiles/tmux.conf .tmux.conf

source ~/.zsh_aliases
source ~/.zsh_functions
source ~/.zsh_settings
```
