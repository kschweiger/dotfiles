# Notes

## ssh

Github provides a way to [use ssh over the https port](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/troubleshooting-ssh/using-ssh-over-the-https-port) which can be used to interact with Github repos using usual ssh setups (ssh-keys, `git@github.com` remotes, ...). 

For this you have to add the following to your ssh config:

```
Host github.com
    Hostname ssh.github.com
    Port 443
    User git    
```

This can be tested with `ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com`. If you are behind a proxy, add

```
    ProxyCommand nc -X connect -x PROXYHOST:PROXYPORT %h %p
```

to the host. `nc` also support authentification if necessary.
